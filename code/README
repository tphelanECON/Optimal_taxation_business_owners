Replication code for the paper ``The Optimal Taxation of Business Owners''. 

All code is written in Python 3.6.5. If you have questions or comments please email me at tom.phelan@clev.frb.org. 

The numerical method used to solve the principal's problem is outlined in the appendix to the paper. 

The replication files contain the following scripts:
 
* classes.py contains two class constructors: CRRA and LOG. These compute the optimal contract, tail parametes and expressions for taxes and transfers for both a 
general CRRA parameter and logarithmic utility. 
* parameters.py lists the parameters used in the examples in the main text. 
* example_CRRA.py computes the policy functions and law of motion of normalized utility for the optimal contract with gamma=2 depicted in the main text.
* example_log.py computes the policy functions and law of motion of normalized utility for the optimal contract with logarithmic utility depicted in the appendix.
* tails.py depicts the tails for consumption and firm size in the stationary distributions associated with the restricted-action allocations. Produces figures both for $\gamma=2$ (shown in the main text) and logarithmic utility (given in the appendix). 
* revenue.py computes the figures for the amount of revenue raised per unit of wealth in the implementation as functions of volatility and leisure.
* stat_dist.py computes the stationary distribution of normalized utility (not shown).
* main.py produces all of the figures in the paper by creating a figures folder and running example_CRRA, example_log, tails and revenue.
